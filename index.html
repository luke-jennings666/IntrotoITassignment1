<h1>Intro to IT Assignment 1</h1>

<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<p>My name is Luke Jennings. My student ID is s3909451. My student email is S3909451@student.rmit.edu.au I was born in the nation’s capital Canberra Australia. My only education was finishing year 10 and some trade school as I learn easier if I have real-life hands-on experience.
An interesting fact about me is that I am an avid motorsport enthusiast, I’ve been in plenty of cars hitting 300kmh plus (on a track of course).</p>

<h4>My interest in IT</h4>
<p>My interest in IT has always mainly been a hardware based interest, as I love tinkering and rebuilding stuff, finding out how all the inner workings are made, I started pulling apart old devices from as early as I can remember, the software side of IT has always been more of an unknown to me (most things I do on pc etc only really require installation of premade apps/programs as do most general consumers) though as time has gone on I have started to gain more of an interest in how software is developed and custom programming and the like.
My interest in IT would have started as a rather young kid, I remember getting my first PC at the age of 7-8, an old Pentium 3 loaded machine that my mother used to use, most of my computer basics were learnt on that one, Years later one day it decided to not want to turn on and I pulled the side panel off and was amazed by what looked like an alien spaceship to my 11 year old brain. A family member helped me pull it apart and get it going again, after that I have always tried to fix my own computers/electronics and had a big love for them.</p>

<h4>Why RMIT?</h4>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT because it was a well-known reputable name, and after consultation worked out it was the best choice for what I want to achieve.</p>

<h1>My ideal job</h1>
<p> <a href=https://www.seek.com.au/job/51660232?type=standard#searchRequestToken=69e9807e-aab5-44dc-8962-abc2095f141f>Electronics Design Engineer</a> </p>

<h4>Job description</h4>
<p>This position is appealing to me because I love hardware, I think designing chips and processors etc would be rather interesting, having a big interest in how it all operates together and what could be better than designing them.</p>

<h4>Skills and Qualifications Needed</h4>
<p>I would need to complete a degree or similar in computer science and work in a junior role for a few years to learn the relevant skills to get into this job.</p>


<h4>Skills and Qualifications i already have</h4>
<p>As it stands now, I have no relevant qualifications for this job which is okay. As for the current skills, I have a good understanding of hardware which I can expand on from here.</p>

<h4>My plan for obtaining the correct skills</h4>
<p>Continue my university studies and complete the computer science degree, I would also try to find a job in the meantime that has relevance to my studies and chosen field to gain more experience while I work towards the degree.</p>

<h4>What do these results mean for me</h4>
</p>I have learned a lot about myself through taking the above tests. Specifically, that I am a visual learner and do not need to do things physically or hands on to be able to grasp them. I am creative and think in abstract, complex ways that are outside the box. I am extraverted and like to surround myself with likeminded people who have the same common interests and goals as I do. I can put others needs before my own. On the flipside, I can often be self-critical and focus on the long-term goals which means I put unnecessary pressure on myself as I am a perfectionist.</p>

<h4>How would these results influence my behaviour in a team</h4>
<p>From the above tests I have learned that I am a people person that can relate to people of all walks of life and can easily build rapport with different personality types. I am highly empathetic and can lead and influence people. I enjoy encouraging people to reach their potential and can help to support my peers. I am able to cooperate well within a team setting and like to know that everyone is treated fairly and has equal say. People with large egos can frustrate me and make me feel uncomfortable.</p>

<h4>How should i take this into account when forming a team</h4>
<p>Because I can relate to people of all different backgrounds, I am driven to be in a leadership role, but I can also function as a peer. I value organisation and methodical thinking so this is a trait I could bring to the group. I am also a visual learner but need to recognise that not everyone learns the same way as I do, and they may need extra support from me to understand my ideas. I appreciate unusual ideas, and do not like anyone to feel excluded. I don’t tolerate any kind of unnecessary negativity, so I think in a team setting I would thrive.</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>My chosen project is a low cost budget oriented direct drive steering wheel for racing simulators made from a servo motor, AASD servo driver, STM32F704 Discovery board and various other parts, It is a bit of a niche market but the lowest priced direct drive on the market currently is around $1500 AUD, I believe I could make these as a cheaper alternative for around $800 (mainly dependant on the quality of servo you pick) Unlike standard consumer grade Steering wheels which output around 3-5nm of torque and feel pretty much like a toy the servo motors can out-put anywhere from 10 to 30+nm which gives a realistic feel of a race car, enough power to injure your wrists if not careful as if you crash the impact would simulate the same impact! I have seen these done in a DIY setting (thrown together) but no one has taken the idea and made it into a marketable product.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>There is a big market for racing simulator gear, from professional race car drivers (for example F1 driver Max Verstappen uses a simulator to keep his skills sharp) or down to your hobby level guys like me that want a realistic simulator to have fun on in their spare time. Track time at a race-track costs hundreds of dollars alone without including the car itself. This would give the average consumer access to realistic racing from the comfort of their own home without breaking the bank.  
Most of the hobby level guys find the direct drive wheels to be out of their reach as the wheel alone without any peripherals, pedals etc can be thousands, Servo motors (see link next page) are cheap and plentiful as are most of the parts to make them.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>To understand why the Direct Drive wheel is the optimal choice for a wheel we first must understand the construction of most consumer steering wheels that are available first.
In the low end (budget) range there is a few different construction methods, the most common wheel is the Logitech G29/G920, which uses a plastic sliding gearset which sits on a film of grease and a rotating bearing with two brushed dc motors powering it. The geared construction and small motors result in a weak feeling wheel with a rough feedback due to gear backlash. Which does not feel real at all. Ones in this price range are around $500 to $600 with pedals etc.
In the next level you have mid-range wheels such as the Fanatec Club-sport or CSL Elite 
These wheels have a belt driven construction and a big internal brushless motor to deliver a way higher power output compared to the low-end wheels, resulting in a way more realistic smooth feel, these are usually the ‘go to’ choice for most simulation racers at a price point of around $800 for the wheelbase only, so no pedals no shifter included. 
In the high end you have the direct drive wheels such as the Fanatec DD1 or Simucube OSW 
These wheels feature similar construction to my wheel, using a big motor directly connected to the wheel, no belts no gears just maximum fidelity and power which is the ideal choice. But the two I listed right here are around $2000 AUD. 
My target market is not just for car enthusiasts, this could help other people such as those learning to drive, who could access the sensation and hone their skills before having the risk of actual oncoming traffic. Furthermore, this could be used as a new technology that helps driving schools explain and physically demonstrate the importance of defensive driving skills. This simulation in the right hands could save lives. On another level, the wheel can serve as a purely entertainment purpose. During the times we live in where overseas travel is restricted and we do not have access to all the luxuries we used to have living in a covid 19 climate, at home gaming is leading the market to fill consumer’s time. 
The benefit of my design would be that beginners, intermediate and experienced drivers could all use it to hone their driving skills.  
Direct Drive wheels do already exist, but I would like mine to be not only affordable but also to be more customisable. The consumer could design their own including colour, backlights, and interchangeable logo to suit their real-life car preferences. For example, a teenage boy whose dream car is a GTR could customise the wheel with that specific logo and button layout to make what is usually a fantasy a reality. For example, a GTR costs $100,000 which is obviously not an achievable price bracket for most of the adolescent’s income. 
Overall, my design aims to be affordable, customisable, and authentic to the driving experience. I visualise a safe to use, and quality design that will not break the bank. It needs to be durable and be made from long lasting materials so that the user can be confident that they will not need to invest in one on a regular basis, but the core model once purchased will last a long time and they can then purchase accessories to enhance the entertainment aspect.</p>

<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<h5>I will give a list of parts with a short explanation on their purpose, some would require further design</h5>
<p>•	Servo motor and AASD servo driver.  Motor and controller that is the base of the wheel. <a href=https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32868662195.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.67274c4d5qpWWV>Servo motor & AASD driver</a>
•	STM32F707-G Microcontroller.  Sends inputs/outputs from the PC to the driver encoder via USB <a href=https://https://au.rs-online.com/web/p/microcontroller-development-tools/9107951/>Microcontroller</a>
•	DB25 cable. Connects AASD driver to the microcontroller. <a href=https://https://www.standard.com.au/product-detail/cables-connectors/connect-to-the-pc-laptop-801/db9-25-cable/db25-cable/db25f-25f-null-modem-2mt-db-25ff-cam302.aspx>DB25 Cable</a>
•	Connectors for db25 to the microcontroller. <a href=https://https://www.robotgear.com.au/Product.aspx/Details/974-0-1-2-54mm-Crimp-Connector-Housing-2x20-Pin-5-Pack>Connectors</a>
•	3d printed wheel adaptor. Or the same but done in CNC aluminium for added strength. Would require CAD drawings to be made. <a href=https://https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1575453>Hub adaptor</a>
•	3d printed/metal manufactured box for the db25 connectors and microcontroller.
•	Metal manufactured mount for the motor to attach to cockpits.
•	Metal manufactured cover for motor.
•	Printed stickers for logos etc. 
•	One steering wheel of your choice. There is 100s of options ones with buttons ones without but I will just list a simple one. <a href=https://https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Nardi-350mm-Deep-Dish-3-Spoke-70mm-PCD-6-Bolt-Black-Leather-Car-Steering-Wheel/333876355327?hash=item4dbc94e0ff:g:vhkAAOSwU39gGRKG>Steering wheel</a>

<h4>Tools required</h4>
<p>
•	Various gauges of wire, crimp connectors, solder, flux, heat shrink.
•	Soldering iron
•	Wire strippers 
•	Wire crimper 
•	3d printer or CNC machine and all related materials.
•	Hand-tools, drills, screwdrivers etc</p>

<h4>Software Needs</h4>
<p>There is already a free open-source program out there that have been designed to work with this, although a custom program would be ideal for more functionality it would not be required to get it up and running. 
The main program is called MMOS, and it has been designed to give and receive force feedback input from a STM32 series Microcontroller. The racing sims detect the wheel as normal, and you are up and racing. This can be found on GitHub or can be downloaded as normal. 
You will also need the ST-link program to flash the microcontroller board with the firmware it needs beforehand. That is done via USB.</p>

<h4>Skills required</h4>
<p>The skills required are not overly extensive but to make a full operation from it you will need people skilled in building software if you go the custom route, or for making firmware updates. Skilled electronics labour for assembling the chip boards into housings and wiring, metalworkers, and CNC operators to make fittings and mounts, you would also need people with knowledge in electronics repair /diagnosis to carry out warranty repairs, quality control fixing faults.</p>

<h1>Outcome</h1>
I think this would be a way to make direct drive steering wheels more accessible to a wider audience as these are only usually seen on very high-end set-ups, or on you-tubers rigs or professional race team simulators, giving more people the chance to have a realistic wheel set-up for minimal financial outlay. As the biggest chunk of the sim racing community is hobbyists it has a bigger target market then the more expensive wheels as well.</p>
